##### How it works
Devis is an AI hackathon buddy that helps participants easily create a compatible team and a project they're interested in. 
Devis:
1. GATHERS HACKATHON & SPONSOR INFO by scraping the Hackathon's Luma
2. IDENTIFIES PARTICIPANT SUPERPOWERS by scraping their LinkedIn & Github to create their hackathon profile
3. TRANSCRIBES NETWORKING CONVERSATIONS using Friend Necklace
4. CREATES PROJECTS that are relevant, impressive and/or business viable projects & 
5. MATCHES PARTICIPANTS INTO TEAMS based on skill compatibility & project interest.
