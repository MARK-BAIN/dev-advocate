***ðŸ¤– Devis Demo ðŸ¤– July 21-22, 2024***

***Technologies used:***

- [MultiOn](https://docs.multion.ai/) - a human-language controlled browser agent (think of agentic Selenium) that lets you interact with any websites using human language rather than a mouse or a keyboard. Useful especially for the ones that require authentication and amazing for tedious tasks

- [AgentOps.ai](https://docs.agentops.ai) - allows you to track your agents execution time/latency, cost, errors, run evals (think of Datadog or Neptune.ai or Sentry)

- [Based Hardware (Friend)](https://docs.basedhardware.com/) - a necklace that listens and passes audio to your mobile account where through a marketplace of agents you can do stuff like talk to Devis, schedule calendar events, alarms, record meetings and much more

- [Mem0 (YC S24)](https://docs.mem0.ai/overview) - an easy to use memory layer for your agents and LLMs. Trending #1 on GitHub over the last week

- [Groq](https://console.groq.com/docs) - the industry leader in latency and cost per 1M tokens providing LPU-based inference to accelerate Open Source Models

- [Wordware (YC S24)](https://wordware.notion.site/d603670c4819487fa75185380c885007?v=91206410afab40dc8d92c189284cdb18) - an agentic IDE (in Notion style) - that I find perfect for prototyping UI and Docs fuelled by the most popular LLMs and agents

- [Anon](https://docs.anon.com/docs) - the toolkit that enables developers to build user-permissioned integrations for sites withoutAPIs. MultiOn uses Anon and enabled Devis to scrape user-permissioned data inaccessible through APIs and protected with bot-protection.

##### How it works
Devis is an AI hackathon buddy that helps participants easily create a compatible team and a project they're interested in. 
Devis:
1. GATHERS HACKATHON & SPONSOR INFO by scraping the Hackathon's Luma
2. IDENTIFIES PARTICIPANT SUPERPOWERS by scraping their LinkedIn & Github to create their hackathon profile
3. TRANSCRIBES NETWORKING CONVERSATIONS using Friend Necklace
4. CREATES PROJECTS that are relevant, impressive and/or business viable projects & 
5. MATCHES PARTICIPANTS INTO TEAMS based on skill compatibility & project interest.


***Python version 3.10+***
